Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Clear Element.mRef immediately after deallocating it

DNSServiceRefDeallocate() and pointer dereferencing in request handler
thread are protected by two separate lock/unlock pairs on mHeadMutex.
If rescan() runs between these, it could dereference mRef, causing
a heap-use-after-free bug.

Solution: set mRef to null immediately after freeing it.

Test: build
